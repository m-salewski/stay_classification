# TODO

## Sythetic data

1. See it's own `README.md`
2. Specifically, create trajectory class to store all the data
    * Use the functions from the scripts and have a few get/set methods

## Illustration

1. $\checkmark$ ~~Find the correct NBs~~
2. Grab the figures 
    * with the overall problem
    * with the box method solution
3. Include realworld example with map and 2D1T plot
    * make the connection to the 1D1T plots
4. Revise and correct the text
5. Create a final html NB

## Evaluation methods

1. Turn evalutation metrics into module

## Box method

1. Refine algorithm and make it robust
2. Ensure that it produces what it should
    * Test it with the evaluations
3. Is it _really_ that different from the SE?
    
## Other methods

1. Piecewise linear
    * can it be made to converge (and faster)?
    * can it be adopted into the box method to improve speed?
        * should it?
    * can it hold up in 2D?

2. Sluster-splitting
    * try again with the random data in batch
    * apply the evaluation
   
3. DB-Scan
    * try again with the random data in batch
    * apply the evaluation
